# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, This is Annie Pacheco ðŸ˜Š
## About me
I am a seasoned Software Developer with over four years of hands-on experience in developing, designing and seamlessly integrating APIs, leveraging cutting-edge technologies.
While my expertise primarily lies in backend technologies, my recent years have seen me actively engage with AI technologies across various projects and application domains.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a bunch of new things regarding AI technologies (llm, langchain, embedchain, etc) and how to integrate them on differents application domains.
